### Recent Implementation: Sourcemap Fix for Dynamic Import Extension Plugin
**Issue**: The `packem:fix-dynamic-import-extension` plugin was causing sourcemap warnings because it was transforming code but not generating proper sourcemaps.

**Root Cause**: The plugin was using simple string replacement (`replaceAll`) and explicitly setting `map: undefined`, which caused Rollup to warn about potentially incorrect sourcemaps.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced simple string replacement with `MagicString` for proper sourcemap generation
- Added proper sourcemap generation using `magicString.generateMap({ hires: true })`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Fixed the warning: `[plugin packem:fix-dynamic-import-extension] Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect`

**Technical Details**:
- **File Modified**: `packages/packem/src/rollup/plugins/fix-dynamic-import-extension.ts`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `MagicString` import and usage
  - Replaced regex-based `replaceAll` with precise `overwrite` operations
  - Added proper sourcemap generation when transformations occur
  - Return original code when no changes are needed (to match test expectations)

**Verification**:
- All existing unit tests pass (8/8 tests)
- Plugin tests suite passes (121/121 tests)
- Dynamic imports example builds successfully without sourcemap warnings
- Sourcemap files are properly generated when `--sourcemap` flag is used
- Transformations work correctly (.ts → .mjs for ESM, .ts → .cjs for CJS)

### Previous Implementation: Extra Conditions Feature
Based on the conversation summary, a significant feature was recently implemented to allow extra conditions in package.json exports validation.

**Feature Overview**:
- Added `extraConditions?: string[]` option to validation configuration
- Allows custom export conditions (like "custom-bundler", "my-framework") to be considered valid
- Enhanced warning messages to guide users about the `extraConditions` option
- Maintains backward compatibility while extending validation capabilities

### Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:
1. **`packages/packem/src/types.ts`**
   - Added `extraConditions?: string[]` to `ValidationOptions` type
   - Includes JSDoc documentation for the new option

2. **`packages/packem/src/validator/package-json/validate-package-fields.ts`**
   - Fixed JSDoc linter errors with better descriptions
   - Enhanced `validateExports` function to accept extra conditions
   - Integrated extra conditions into the validation logic
   - Improved warning messages to guide users about the `extraConditions` option

3. **`packages/packem/src/rollup/plugins/fix-dynamic-import-extension.ts`** (NEW)
   - Fixed sourcemap generation issue
   - Added proper MagicString-based transformations
   - Resolved Rollup sourcemap warnings

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the extra conditions feature
   - Tests cover custom condition acceptance and proper warning behavior
   - Added tests for enhanced warning messages with different scenarios
   - All dynamic import plugin tests pass

5. **Documentation**
   - Created example documentation showing usage patterns
   - Added examples demonstrating enhanced warning messages

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Extra conditions feature is fully implemented and tested
- Sourcemap fix for dynamic import extension plugin is complete
- Unit tests pass for both features
- JSDoc linting errors have been resolved
- Backward compatibility maintained for both features
- Dynamic imports example builds successfully without warnings

### Known Issues
- Integration tests failing due to missing `oxc-walker` dependency
- This appears to be an environment/dependency issue, not related to the feature implementations

### Recent Changes Context
The extra conditions feature addresses a real need in the ecosystem where:
- Custom bundlers need their own export conditions
- Framework-specific conditions are becoming common
- Tooling-specific conditions require validation support

The sourcemap fix addresses a common issue where:
- Rollup plugins that transform code need proper sourcemap generation
- `MagicString` is the standard approach for this in the Rollup ecosystem
- Proper sourcemaps are essential for debugging and development tools

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Resolve Integration Test Issues**
   - Investigate `oxc-walker` dependency issue
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI environment
   - May need to update dependencies or fix import paths

2. **Feature Validation**
   - Test both features with real-world scenarios
   - Validate documentation examples work correctly
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

### Future Enhancements
1. **Extended Validation**
   - Consider adding validation for condition naming conventions
   - Implement warnings for potentially problematic condition names
   - Add suggestions for common typos in condition names

2. **Plugin Improvements**
   - Consider adding more comprehensive sourcemap testing
   - Evaluate performance impact of MagicString usage
   - Document best practices for plugin sourcemap generation

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add more real-world examples to documentation
   - Include best practices for custom conditions
   - Document integration with popular tools and frameworks

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Configuration Location**: Added to `ValidationOptions.packageJson.extraConditions`
2. **Type Safety**: Used `string[]` for flexibility while maintaining type safety
3. **Validation Logic**: Integrated into existing condition validation without breaking changes
4. **Error Handling**: Maintains existing warning behavior for truly unknown conditions
5. **Sourcemap Generation**: Used `MagicString` following established patterns in the codebase

### Open Questions
1. **Condition Naming**: Should there be validation for condition naming conventions?
2. **Performance**: Is the current Set-based approach optimal for large condition lists?
3. **Documentation**: What additional examples would be most helpful for users?
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Should other plugins be audited for similar sourcemap issues?

### Technical Considerations
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing behavior preserved
2. **Performance Impact**: Minimal - only affects validation phase and plugin transformation
3. **Memory Usage**: Negligible increase from additional Set creation and MagicString usage
4. **API Design**: Follows existing patterns in the codebase

## Current Development Environment

### Workspace State
- Nx workspace with pnpm package manager
- Node.js 18+ environment (Linux 6.12.34-1-lts)
- TypeScript 5.8+ with strict type checking
- Vitest for testing framework

### Build Status
- Main package builds successfully
- Unit tests pass for both new features
- Integration tests have dependency issues (non-blocking for features)
- ESLint and TypeScript checks pass
- Sourcemap generation working correctly

### Dependencies
- All runtime dependencies properly installed
- Development dependencies available
- Optional transformer dependencies (esbuild, SWC, etc.) available
- Issue with `oxc-walker` in test environment
- `MagicString` properly integrated for sourcemap generation

## Team Context

### Development Workflow
- Feature development following established patterns
- Comprehensive testing before implementation
- Documentation-first approach for new features
- Backward compatibility as a priority
- Proper sourcemap handling for all transformations

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive test coverage
- ESLint rule adherence
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Proper sourcemap generation for all code transformations

Both features represent solid additions to Packem's capabilities, addressing real user needs while maintaining the project's high standards for code quality and backward compatibility. The sourcemap fix specifically improves the developer experience by eliminating warnings and ensuring proper debugging support.
