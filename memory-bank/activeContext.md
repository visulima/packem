## Current Work Focus

### Recent Implementation: Extra Conditions Feature
Based on the conversation summary, a significant feature was recently implemented to allow extra conditions in package.json exports validation.

**Feature Overview**:
- Added `extraConditions?: string[]` option to validation configuration
- Allows custom export conditions (like "custom-bundler", "my-framework") to be considered valid
- Enhanced warning messages to guide users about the `extraConditions` option
- Maintains backward compatibility while extending validation capabilities

### Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:
1. **`packages/packem/src/types.ts`**
   - Added `extraConditions?: string[]` to `ValidationOptions` type
   - Includes JSDoc documentation for the new option

2. **`packages/packem/src/validator/package-json/validate-package-fields.ts`**
   - Fixed JSDoc linter errors with better descriptions
   - Enhanced `validateExports` function to accept extra conditions
   - Integrated extra conditions into the validation logic
   - Improved warning messages to guide users about the `extraConditions` option

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the new functionality
   - Tests cover custom condition acceptance and proper warning behavior
   - Added tests for enhanced warning messages with different scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Created example documentation showing usage patterns
   - Added examples demonstrating enhanced warning messages

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Extra conditions feature is fully implemented and tested
- Unit tests pass for the specific feature
- JSDoc linting errors have been resolved
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Known Issues
- Integration tests failing due to missing `oxc-walker` dependency
- This appears to be an environment/dependency issue, not related to the feature implementation

### Recent Changes Context
The extra conditions feature addresses a real need in the ecosystem where:
- Custom bundlers need their own export conditions
- Framework-specific conditions are becoming common
- Tooling-specific conditions require validation support

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Resolve Integration Test Issues**
   - Investigate `oxc-walker` dependency issue
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI environment
   - May need to update dependencies or fix import paths

2. **Feature Validation**
   - Test the feature with real-world scenarios
   - Validate documentation examples work correctly
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

### Future Enhancements
1. **Extended Validation**
   - Consider adding validation for condition naming conventions
   - Implement warnings for potentially problematic condition names
   - Add suggestions for common typos in condition names

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add more real-world examples to documentation
   - Include best practices for custom conditions
   - Document integration with popular tools and frameworks

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Configuration Location**: Added to `ValidationOptions.packageJson.extraConditions`
2. **Type Safety**: Used `string[]` for flexibility while maintaining type safety
3. **Validation Logic**: Integrated into existing condition validation without breaking changes
4. **Error Handling**: Maintains existing warning behavior for truly unknown conditions

### Open Questions
1. **Condition Naming**: Should there be validation for condition naming conventions?
2. **Performance**: Is the current Set-based approach optimal for large condition lists?
3. **Documentation**: What additional examples would be most helpful for users?

### Technical Considerations
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing behavior preserved
2. **Performance Impact**: Minimal - only affects validation phase
3. **Memory Usage**: Negligible increase from additional Set creation
4. **API Design**: Follows existing patterns in the codebase

## Current Development Environment

### Workspace State
- Nx workspace with pnpm package manager
- Node.js 18+ environment (Linux 6.12.34-1-lts)
- TypeScript 5.8+ with strict type checking
- Vitest for testing framework

### Build Status
- Main package builds successfully
- Unit tests pass for new feature
- Integration tests have dependency issues (non-blocking for feature)
- ESLint and TypeScript checks pass

### Dependencies
- All runtime dependencies properly installed
- Development dependencies available
- Optional transformer dependencies (esbuild, SWC, etc.) available
- Issue with `oxc-walker` in test environment

## Team Context

### Development Workflow
- Feature development following established patterns
- Comprehensive testing before implementation
- Documentation-first approach for new features
- Backward compatibility as a priority

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive test coverage
- ESLint rule adherence
- Documentation for all public APIs

This feature represents a solid addition to Packem's validation capabilities, addressing real user needs while maintaining the project's high standards for code quality and backward compatibility.
