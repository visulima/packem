# Progress: Visulima Packem Development

## Completed Features

### ✅ Extra Conditions Validation Feature
**Status**: Complete and tested
**Implementation Date**: Recent
**Description**: Added support for custom export conditions in package.json validation

**What Works**:
- `extraConditions?: string[]` configuration option
- Custom conditions are recognized as valid during validation
- Enhanced warning messages guide users to the `extraConditions` option
- Comprehensive test coverage with 100% pass rate
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- JSDoc documentation and examples provided

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `ValidationOptions` type in `packages/packem/src/types.ts`
- Enhanced validation logic in `validate-package-fields.ts`
- Added unit tests covering all scenarios
- Created documentation examples

### ✅ Sourcemap Fix for Dynamic Import Extension Plugin
**Status**: Complete and verified
**Implementation Date**: Current session
**Description**: Fixed sourcemap generation issue in the `packem:fix-dynamic-import-extension` plugin

**What Works**:
- Proper sourcemap generation using `MagicString`
- Eliminates Rollup warning: `[plugin packem:fix-dynamic-import-extension] Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect`
- Maintains all existing functionality for dynamic import transformations
- Generates correct sourcemap files when `--sourcemap` flag is used
- All unit tests pass (8/8 for the specific plugin, 121/121 for all plugins)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Replaced simple string replacement with `MagicString` for precise transformations
- Added proper sourcemap generation with `magicString.generateMap({ hires: true })`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing test expectations
- Follows established patterns used by other plugins in the codebase

**Verification Results**:
- Dynamic imports example builds without warnings
- Sourcemap files are properly generated (.map files created)
- Transformations work correctly (.ts → .mjs for ESM, .ts → .cjs for CJS)
- All existing functionality preserved

## Current Status

### What's Fully Working
1. **Package.json Validation System**
   - Standard export conditions validation
   - Community conditions recognition
   - Custom conditions support via `extraConditions`
   - Comprehensive warning and error messages

2. **Dynamic Import Handling**
   - Extension transformation (.ts → .mjs/.cjs)
   - Proper sourcemap generation
   - Support for multiple quote styles
   - Variable dynamic import runtime generation

3. **Build System**
   - ESM and CJS output generation
   - Sourcemap support
   - Code transformation pipeline
   - Plugin architecture

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for validation logic
   - Plugin-specific tests
   - Integration test framework (with known dependency issues)

### What's Left to Build

#### High Priority
1. **Integration Test Fixes**
   - Resolve `oxc-walker` dependency issue
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI environment
   - Fix any remaining test environment issues

2. **Documentation Completion**
   - Real-world usage examples for extra conditions
   - Best practices guide for custom conditions
   - Plugin development guidelines including sourcemap handling

#### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced Validation Features**
   - Condition naming convention validation
   - Suggestions for common typos in conditions
   - Performance optimization for large condition sets

2. **Plugin Architecture Improvements**
   - Audit other plugins for sourcemap issues
   - Standardize sourcemap generation patterns
   - Performance monitoring for MagicString usage

#### Low Priority
1. **Developer Experience**
   - More comprehensive error messages
   - Better debugging support
   - Enhanced CLI output

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching strategies for validation
   - Bundle size optimizations
   - Build speed improvements

## Known Issues

### Test Environment
- **Issue**: Integration tests failing due to missing `oxc-walker` dependency
- **Impact**: Non-blocking for feature development
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Priority**: Medium

### Documentation Gaps
- **Issue**: Some advanced usage patterns not documented
- **Impact**: User experience could be improved
- **Status**: Ongoing improvement
- **Priority**: Low

## Recent Achievements

### Technical Milestones
1. **Sourcemap Generation**: Successfully implemented proper sourcemap handling in Rollup plugins
2. **Validation System**: Extended package.json validation to support custom export conditions
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% test pass rate for implemented features
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing API compatibility

### Quality Improvements
1. **Warning Elimination**: Resolved Rollup sourcemap warnings
2. **Code Standards**: All code follows established patterns and ESLint rules
3. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc and usage examples
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and user guidance

## Development Workflow Status

### Working Well
- Feature development following established patterns
- Comprehensive testing before implementation
- Documentation-first approach
- Proper sourcemap handling for all transformations
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Areas for Improvement
- Integration test reliability
- CI/CD pipeline stability
- Documentation coverage for advanced scenarios

## Next Development Cycle

### Immediate Focus
1. Fix integration test environment issues
2. Complete documentation for both implemented features
3. Validate features with real-world usage scenarios

### Future Considerations
1. Plugin architecture standardization
2. Performance optimization opportunities
3. Additional validation features based on user feedback

Both the extra conditions feature and sourcemap fix represent significant improvements to Packem's capabilities and developer experience, addressing real user needs while maintaining high code quality standards.
