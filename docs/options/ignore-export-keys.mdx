# ignoreExportKeys

Array of export keys to ignore during entry inference. Useful for excluding exports that only contain images or other non-JavaScript assets.

## Type

```typescript
ignoreExportKeys?: string[]
```

## Default

`undefined` (no exports are ignored)

## Description

When packem processes your `package.json` exports, it tries to find corresponding source files for each export. However, some exports may only contain non-JavaScript assets (like images, CSS files, etc.) that don't have corresponding source files to build.

By default, packem will generate warnings for exports where it can't find source files. Use `ignoreExportKeys` to tell packem to skip these exports entirely.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// packem.config.ts
import type { BuildConfig } from "@visulima/packem";

const config: BuildConfig = {
  ignoreExportKeys: ["images", "assets", "styles"],
};

export default config;
```

### With package.json exports

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.mjs",
    "./images": "./dist/images/icon.png",
    "./assets": "./dist/assets/logo.svg",
    "./styles": "./dist/styles.css"
  }
}
```

With `ignoreExportKeys: ["images", "assets", "styles"]`, only the main export (`"."`) will be processed as a build entry.

### CLI Usage

```bash
packem build --ignore-export-keys=images,assets,styles
```

## Notes

- Export keys are matched without the `./` prefix (e.g., `"./images"` matches `"images"`)
- Ignored exports are still included in the final `package.json` for consumers
- No warnings are generated for ignored exports
- Works with both simple string exports and nested conditional exports

## Related Options

When using `ignoreExportKeys` with asset exports, you may also want to configure:

- `validation.packageJson.allowedExportExtensions` - Add custom file extensions to the valid export extensions list
- `rollup.copy` - Copy asset files to the output directory
