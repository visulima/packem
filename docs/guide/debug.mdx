# Debug & Profiling

Learn how to debug your Packem builds and profile performance to identify bottlenecks and optimize your build process.

## Build Profiling

Performing a performance analysis can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your project, allowing for targeted optimization.

### Node.js Profiling

When Packem executes a build, it will include the runtime overhead of both JavaScript and Rust code, and the overhead of data communication between JavaScript and Rust.

In general, the performance overhead on the JavaScript side will be greater than that on the Rust side. You can use Node.js profiling to analyze the overhead on the JS side, which helps to identify performance bottlenecks on the JS side.

For example, to perform the CPU profiling analysis, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
# dev
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@visulima/packem/bin/packem.js dev

# build
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@visulima/packem/bin/packem.js build

# Set higher precision sampling interval
node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-interval=100 ./node_modules/@visulima/packem/bin/packem.js build
```

The above commands will generate a `*.cpuprofile` file. We can use [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/) to visualize this file:

```bash
# Install speedscope
npm install -g speedscope

# View cpuprofile content
# Replace the name with the local file name
speedscope CPU.date.000000.00000.0.001.cpuprofile
```

## Debug Mode

Packem provides debug options to help troubleshoot build issues and get more detailed information about the build process.

### Debug Build Output

Packem includes a `--debug` flag that enables additional logging and debugging information during the build process:

```bash
# Enable debug logging during build
packem build --debug

# Enable debug logging in watch mode
packem build --watch --debug
```

When debug mode is enabled, you'll see additional log messages prefixed with `packem` that provide insight into:

- Configuration loading and processing
- Plugin registration and execution
- Build steps and file processing
- Internal operations and decisions

### Verbose Logging

In debug mode, Packem will output detailed information about:

- **System Information**: Node.js version, bundler version, transformer being used
- **Configuration**: Which config files are loaded and their paths
- **Build Process**: Entry detection, file processing, and build phases
- **Plugin Activity**: Plugin initialization and processing details

Example debug output:

```bash
$ packem build --debug

00:35:12 INFO      [packem] [system] Using node 25.1.0
00:35:12 INFO      [packem] [bundler] Using rollup 4.53.2 with browser build runtime

```

### TypeDoc Debug Information

When using TypeDoc for documentation generation, the debug flag also enables TypeDoc's configuration display, showing how TypeDoc is configured internally.
